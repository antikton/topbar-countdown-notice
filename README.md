## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this for a scheduled sale?

**Yes!** Set the Start Date/Time to when your sale begins and the End Date/Time to when it ends. Enable the countdown to target the End Date for maximum urgency.

### What happens when the countdown ends?

You have two options:
1. **Hide the bar** - The bar disappears automatically
2. **Show alternative content** - Replace with a new message (e.g., "This offer has expired")

### Is it mobile friendly?

**Absolutely!** The top bar is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes, including mobile devices.

### Can I reveal a discount code after the countdown ends?

**Absolutely!** This is a popular use case. Set up a countdown to build anticipation, then use the "Show alternative content" option to reveal your discount code, coupon, or special offer when the timer reaches zero. You can even change the colors to make it stand out! See the "Countdown to Promotion Start + Reveal Coupon" example in the Usage section.

### Can I customize the appearance?

**Yes!** You have complete control over:
- Background and text colors
- Padding (top, bottom, left, right)
- Custom CSS for advanced styling
- Alternative colors for expired content

### Does it work with caching plugins?

The plugin uses JavaScript for countdown functionality, which works with most caching plugins. However, for time-sensitive content, you may need to configure your cache to refresh appropriately.

### Can I translate the plugin?

**Yes!** The plugin is fully translation-ready with the text domain `topbar-countdown-notice`. You can use tools like Loco Translate or create your own `.po` and `.mo` files.

### How do I remove the bar temporarily?

Simply uncheck "Activate Bar" in the General Settings and save. This will hide the bar without losing your configuration.

### Can I show different bars on different pages?

Currently, the plugin displays a single global bar across all pages. Page-specific targeting may be added in future versions.
